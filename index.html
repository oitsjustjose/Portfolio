            <h3 class="ui header">My name is Jose Stovall</h3>
            <p>I was born on September 14, 1995.
                <br><br>Since the age of 9, I've had an interest in technology which only evolved as the years go by. I got my first computer and iPod on my 12th birthday. From that moment on, I've constantly strived to teach myself how to do things even
                the simplest of computing tasks.
                <br><br>Preceeding my sophomore year of high school, I was so interested in computing (still using the same desktop computer that was my first, by the way) that I decided to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNbEBARu6LY&list=PLC315B2A086BA6AAF">look up how computers work</a>                and learned how to build a computer through repetitive disassembly and reassembly of an old family desktop. By the time my sophomore year started, I decided to sign up for the Computer Science class offered at LaVergne High School. Ever
                since then, I've had a deep passion for computer hardware, which was only bound to develop!
                <br><br>By 2011, I had graduated LaVergne High School and took my first ever computing class at a college level, which taught basic HTML (sans CSS and JavaScript). At the time, I had originally chosen to study Digital Animation, but these
                beginning programming concepts really caught my attention. Meanhwile, a friend and I were highly involved in a game called <a href="http://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, and we decided that we weren't thrilled with some of the recent changes
                the developers had made to the game. <b><i>So we decided to make our first programming endeavours to change them back</i></b>. Hours of frustration later, and my friend and I had finally figured out how to decompile and deobfuscate Minecraft's
                source code so we could edit it (using a tool called <a href="http://www.modcoderpack.com/website/">MCP</a>). Once I could finally see the source code, it didn't take me long at all to find the exact .java file I was in search of, and
                make the very simple edit I wanted to make.
