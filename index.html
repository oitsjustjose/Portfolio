        <h2>Hi there, my name is Jose!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a full-stack developer, data scientist, DevOPs enthusiast and game modder! As you can probably tell, I
            have a lot of eggs in a lot of baskets, but I'm just so interested in the entire scope of software
            development that that's sort of what happens! I got started learning Java back in 2011 to learn how to mod
            Minecraft (which I still do!), and since then I've learned more advanced systems, languages, paradigms and
            architectures that have gotten me to where I am today!
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in May of 2020 and have since started a position
            at <a href="https://basecamp-health.com" target="_blank">Base Camp Health</a>. Here I've developed a
            COVID-19 preparation platform written in React (FE) and Express (BE). You can find this and all of my other
            work experience on my <a href="/Experience">Experience Page</a>, my other projects on my <a
                href="/Portfolio">Portfolio Page</a>, and my education on the <a href="/Education">Education Page</a>!
        </p>

        <p>
            Otherwise, on this page you'll find a list of my talents and skills as well as some software tools I'm
            familair with.
        </p>

        <h4>Computer Vision + ML</h4>

        <p>
            Since 2017, I've had experience of using Python for various computer vision tasks, ranging from detection
            via CNN (including <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/" target="_blank">YOLO</a>). I'm quite
            familiar with making models using Keras + Tensorflow, and am reasonably comfortable with <i>using</i> CUDA
            for graphical acceleration (such as CUDA-accelerated CNNs, CUDA-accelerated FFMPEG for real-time decoding,
            and more). In addition, as part of my college research program at <a href="https://utccuip.com"
                target="_blank">CUIP</a> I learned how to design and integrate YOLO with other algorithms such as object
            tracking and even near-miss sdetection!
        </p>

        <h4>Data Science & Analytics</h4>

        <p>
            In my time at Base Camp Health I have used my Python Data Science skills to combine my Panads knowledge with
            my interests in scalability and parallelism. By combining several public data sources with private,
            anonymized Blue Cross Blue Shield AL data, I was able to expand their provided dataset to include
            information on other non-medical factors (SDOH, or Social Determinants of Health) which helped describe
            if/how members were able to receive their care as well as their day-to-day living situations such as whether
            they live in a food desert, a high-poverty area, etc..

        <h2>Full-Stack Web Development</h2>

        <h4>Frontend</h4>

        <p>
            Before starting as a developer in the workforce, I began to learn frontend development via HTML/CSS/Vanilla
            JS. I later learned JQuery as it shipped with <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/"
                target="_blank">Semantic-UI</a>. Several years later I decided to learn the inner-workings and behaviors
            of JavaScript by learning how to re-invent features added by JQuery in Vanilla JS.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once I joined at Base Camp Health, I was forced to finally sit down and learn a frontend UI framework (which
            up until then was overkill for the types of frontend work I had been doing). Once I got the hang of it,
            React has become one of favorite frontend frameworks for dynamic content and to this day several of my
            websites have been rewritten from Vanilla JS + DOM to React for the sake of simplicity and future
            maintenance.
        </p>

        <h4>Backend</h4>

        <p>
            In the last year of graduate school at UTC, I began to learn backend frameworks in order to translate
            frontend data into database entries. I had already gained familiarity in MongoDB from my research and MySQL
            from school, so that wasn't a challenge. However, learning how to use ExpressJS and use the Mongoose MongoDB
            wrapper was challenging because at the time async/await was still an unfamiliar concept for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within about 2 months of learning and exploring backend development, I began to see how the server's
            relationship with the client, and the database's relationship with the server, were all unpredictable from a
            timing perspective. This finally allowed me to understand how async worked and why certainc contexts were
            asynchronous and why it was necessary to await them.
        </p>

        <p>
            From there I began to also understand why typings in JavaScript would be helpful for the rigidity of a
            backend server, so I began to learn TypeScript which has now become a go-to of mine for any backend work.
        </p>

        <h2>Java</h2>

        <p>
            So it's funny, this is actually what got me into development in the first place! I originally started my
            pursuit for higher education in 2011, where I decided I wanted to get a degree in Digital Animation but
            never wanted to work for Pixar or Dreamwork ðŸ¤”. After a semester of this, I took some time to reflect and
            couldn't come up with anything interesting even in the slightest, until a friend of mine convinced me to try
            modding <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> - everyone's favorite block-based
            sandbox.
        </p>

        <p>
            We spent the entire winter break on 12-18 hour Skype calls, and ended up making a terrifyingly awful (at
            least, in hindsight) mod for Minecraft. While I had no idea what I was doing (and wouldn't for another 4
            years), I enjoyed the ability to manipulate things we use every day with some code.
            <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/oitsjustjose/projects" target="_blank">I still make mods</a> and
            recently hit <b>10 Million Mod Downloads</b> via the most commonly used mod hosting platform. I still can't
            believe my content has come this far, but with practice and dedication I've been able to refine my mods to
            levels I could've never imagined!

        <h2>Tools and Software</h2>

        <h5>Editors</h5>
        <p>
            I use VSCode for <i>everything</i>!! I'm preferential to it because the entire package size of it,
            along with the extensions I use, is still smaller than any single JetBrains IDE. Even VSCode won't hold
            your hand through some languages, I find this to be a good thing since I'll have to be more mindful of
            the specificities of that language (GO and Java in particular!).
        </p>
        <p>
            If I'm in a remote environment, I primarily use Nano. I know how to use VI/VIM, but while many people
            argue that "VI[M] is alwayson every machine", most modern machines also ship with Nano nowadays too ðŸ˜€
        </p>

        <h5>Shell</h5>
        <p>
            I prefer ZSH + OhMyZSH, though I regularly use Bash for remote machines like EC2 instances.
        </p>

        <h5>Deployments</h5>
        <p>
            For deployments, I used to manually stand them up and use NGINX for routing and <code>systemd</code> for
            executing, but recently I've been learning and deploying using Docker. While I know how to use
            Kubernetes and have used it at Base Camp Health, it's always been overkill for my small websites.
