        <h2>Hi there, my name is Jose!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a full-stack developer, DevOPs enthusiast and Game Developer at <a
                href="https://www.freerangegames.com/">Free Range Games</a>. At FRG, I've been part of various processes
            all the way through; I started out leveraging my knowledge of large-scale analytics using the <a
                href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack" target="_blank">Elastic Stack</a>, but then got my hands
            dirty with actually implementing real-time events in the game source. Before I knew it I was fixing bugs
            left and right and outright implementing entire new features for <a
                href="https://www.freerangegames.com/return-to-moria" target="_blank">Return to Moria</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
            After RTM launched I moved onto support <a href="https://www.freerangegames.com/wrekless"
                target="_blank">Wrekless</a> with many dedicated server tasks, largely focusing on the DevOPs components
            and ensuring that necessary backend services would scale out to meet the needs of the playerbase. Now I'm
            back on RTM helping to implement an in-house analytics engine that is much more lean and performant than the
            prior implementation built before RTM's initial launch!
        </p>

            You can find more information about my professional and educational experience (as well as some free-lance
            and side work!) on my other pages. Continuing to read below, you'll find the remainder of my most commonly
            used and honed skills for your perusal. Thank you!

        <h4>Computer Vision + ML</h4>

        <p>
            Since 2017, I've had experience of using Python for various computer
            vision tasks, ranging from detection via CNN (including
            <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/" target="_blank">YOLO</a>).
            I'm quite familiar with making models using Keras + Tensorflow, and am
            reasonably comfortable with <i>using</i> CUDA for graphical acceleration
            (such as CUDA-accelerated CNNs, CUDA-accelerated FFMPEG for real-time
            decoding, and more). In addition, as part of my college research program
            at <a href="https://utccuip.com" target="_blank">CUIP</a> I learned how
            to design and integrate YOLO with other algorithms such as object
            tracking and even near-miss detection!
        </p>

        <h4>Data Science &amp; Analytics</h4>

        <p>
            In my time at Base Camp Health I have used my Python Data Science skills
            to combine my Pandas knowledge with my interests in scalability and
            parallelism. By combining several public data sources with private,
            anonymized Blue Cross Blue Shield AL data, I was able to expand their
            provided dataset to include information on other non-medical factors
            (SDOH, or Social Determinants of Health) which helped describe if/how
            members were able to receive their care as well as their day-to-day
            living situations such as whether they live in a food desert, a
            high-poverty area, etc..

        <h2>Full-Stack Web Development</h2>

        <h4>Frontend</h4>

        <p>
            Before starting as a developer in the workforce, I began to learn
            frontend development via HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS. I later learned JQuery as
            it shipped with
            <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/" target="_blank">Semantic-UI</a>.
            Several years later I decided to learn the inner-workings and behaviors
            of JavaScript by learning how to re-invent features added by JQuery in
            Vanilla JS.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once I joined at Base Camp Health, I was forced to finally sit down and
            learn a frontend UI framework (which up until then was overkill for the
            types of frontend work I had been doing). Once I got the hang of it,
            React has become one of favorite frontend frameworks for dynamic content
            and to this day several of my websites have been rewritten from Vanilla
            JS + DOM to React for the sake of simplicity and future maintenance.
        </p>

        <h4>Backend</h4>

        <p>
            In the last year of graduate school at UTC, I began to learn backend
            frameworks in order to translate frontend data into database entries. I
            had already gained familiarity in MongoDB from my research and MySQL
            from school, so that wasn't a challenge. However, learning how to use
            ExpressJS and use the Mongoose MongoDB wrapper was challenging because
            at the time async/await was still an unfamiliar concept for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within about 2 months of learning and exploring backend development, I
            began to see how the server's relationship with the client, and the
            database's relationship with the server, were all unpredictable from a
            timing perspective. This finally allowed me to understand how async
            worked and why certain contexts were asynchronous and why it was
            necessary to await them.
        </p>

        <p>
            From there I began to also understand why typings in JavaScript would be
            helpful for the rigidity of a backend server, so I began to learn
            TypeScript which has now become a go-to of mine for any backend work.
        </p>

        <h2>Java</h2>

        <p>
            So it's funny, this is actually what got me into development in the
            first place! I originally started my pursuit for higher education in
            2011, where I decided I wanted to get a degree in Digital Animation but
            never wanted to work for Pixar or Dreamworks ðŸ¤”. After a semester of
            this, I took some time to reflect and couldn't come up with anything
            interesting even in the slightest, until a friend of mine convinced me
            to try modding
            <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> -
            everyone's favorite block-based sandbox.
        </p>

        <p>
            We spent the entire winter break on 12-18 hour Skype calls, and ended up
            making a terrifyingly awful (at least, in hindsight) mod for Minecraft.
            While I had no idea what I was doing (and wouldn't for another 4 years),
            I enjoyed the ability to manipulate things we use every day with some
            code.
            <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/oitsjustjose/projects" target="_blank">I still make mods</a>
            and they're nearing <b>30 Million Mod Downloads</b> via the most commonly
            used mod hosting platform. I still can't believe my content has come
            this far, but with practice and dedication I've been able to refine my
            mods to levels I could've never imagined!
