            <p> Since the age of 9, I've had an interest in technology which only evolved as the years go by. I got my
                first computer and iPod on my 12th birthday. From that moment on, I've constantly strived to teach
                myself how to do things even the simplest of computing tasks. </p>
            <p> Preceeding my sophomore year of high school, I was so interested in computing (still using the same
                desktop computer that was my first, by the way) that I decided to <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNbEBARu6LY&list=PLC315B2A086BA6AAF">look up how computers
                    work</a> and learned how to build a computer through repetitive disassembly and reassembly of an old
                family desktop. By the time my sophomore year started, I decided to sign up for the Computer Science
                class offered at LaVergne High School. Ever since then, I've had a deep passion for computer hardware,
                which was only bound to develop! </p>
            <p>By 2011, I had graduated LaVergne High School and took my first ever computing class at a college level,
                which taught basic HTML (sans CSS and JavaScript). At the time, I had originally chosen to study Digital
                Animation, but these beginning programming concepts really caught my attention. Meanhwile, a friend and
                I were highly involved in a game called <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft </a>, and we decided
                that we weren't thrilled with some of the recent changes the developers had made to the game. <b><i>So
                        we decided to make our first programming endeavours to change them back</i></b>. Hours of
                frustration later, and my friend and I had finally figured out how to decompile and deobfuscate
                Minecraft's source code so we could edit it (using a tool called MCP - now extinct). Once I could
                finally see the source code, it didn't take me long at all to find the exact .java file I was in search
                of, and make the very simple edit I wanted to make. </p>
