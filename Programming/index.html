                        In 2018, Dr. Mina Sartipi at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga started a research group

                            and Progress
                            (CUIP)</a>. CUIP has aimed to be a nexus for collaboration with members of the city, other
                        universities, and more. With our partnerships, we have been granted 16 poles on a mile-long
                        stretch of Martin Luther King Blvd.. With this, we have launched a scalable infrastructure
                        capable of expanding both hardware and software. As part of an ever-expanding project, I have
                        created an object tracker (seen <a href="https://www.utccuip.com/object-tracking"
                            target="_blank">here</a>) that is parallelized, resilient and produces nearly 500,000 data
                        entries a week <i>per camera</i>. This algorithm allows us to store anonymous data on Kafka, and
                        functions in <b>real time</b>. This algorithm allows for many data analytics in the future, and
                        has already revealed many trends that can be addressed by the city or its members. <br>

                        Below is a graphic which has been generated using OpenCV2 and the data gathered from the
                        application I have created. WIth it, it is easy to see many trends. <br>

                        To follow up on our CAV (Connected Autonomous Vehicles) initiative, for the 2018 conference the
                        team
                        decided to work on a unified map for anonymously mapping many subjects of interest. For the most
                        part, the above video I made should suffice as explanation, but it was fun being the <b>only

                        This programming project was quite a hurdle for me. The 2017 SCCC was in late June, and I joined
                        the
                        research group in early May. I had never done networking, computer vision or machine learning in
                        my
                        life, nor had I ever written in Python. Yet our team managed to get this together, with myself
                        handling at least 70% of the workload. This project had a live-demo that took everyone by
                        surprise,
                        but was <i>incredibly</i> stressful on my end. Nonetheless, this was the first time that I felt
                        confident that I could accomplish anything I ever wanted.

                        This wasn't my first use of Java's Libraries to produce a desktop program, but this was my first
                        attempt to make a <i>good</i> one! As part of an assigned group, myself and 4 others were
                        instructed
                        to design (using any language)
                        a Class Registration Program. I feel as though this program was a large accomplishment for us
                        all -
                        it had several productivity-intensive features, such as the ability to print schedules, add and
                        remove users, and more!<br><br>
                        In the end, I truly feel like we all brought something special to the table. One of the group
                        members taught me about Java Serialization and how wonderful it can be. Meanwhile, I brought
                        about a
                        structure for our window system,
                        how the window's contents would be managed and placed, as well as how the UI was going to
                        dynamically theme itself based on Operating System.

                        <br><br>I enjoy playing games, and writing mods for Minecraft is a great way of practicing
                        programming, debugging, API usage and more. All of my mods depend on the <a
                            href="http://minecraftforge.net">Minecraft Forge API</a>. As a result, I constantly aim to
                        maximize compatibility with up to <i>thousands</i> of other mods, plus for each Minecraft update
                        I
                        must adapt my code to not <i>only</i> Minecraft's codebase changes, but Forge's as well.
                        <br><br>The result? I feel like my ability to be tossed into any programming environment and
                        survive
                        is much better than most programmers which are still studying in school.
