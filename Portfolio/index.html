                        In my spare time I love to take on side projects for family, friends and myself alike. To date, I have created, managed and continued to maintain the following sites from code all the way to server deployment and routing:

                            As of late, these mod downloads have totaled to over 10-million!

                            Created &amp; maintained website for PEER Place, a delightful
                            non-profit company which aims to empower those with
                            developmental differences to allow them to become more
                            independent and achieve their highest potential within
                            themselves. In 2022 a local church took over PEER Place and as
                            per their request, the site was taken down in that same year.

                                The fifteen teams in the competition were tasked with creating
                                a mobile app that allows consumers to digitally keep track of
                                their physical conditions. The first and second place teams
