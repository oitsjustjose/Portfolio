                            On March 4th 2020, I defended my thesis titled "Video Analytics on the MLK Smart Corridor
                            Testbed". This thesis was accepted and has been <a
                                href="https://scholar.utc.edu/theses/655/" target="_blank">published via UTC
                                Scholars</a>. This thesis discussed many forms of <b>real-time</b> scalable video
                            analytics that were done under <a href="https://utccuip.com/" target="_blank">CUIP</a>.

                            This was my first detailed look at HTML, CSS and JavaScript - before this point I only had
                            minor experience, and still only consider myself amateur at best. Regardless, this was a
                            fantastic learning experience and great practive of my program design skills!

                                were tasked with creating a mobile app that allows consumers to digitally keep track
                                of their physical conditions. The first and second place teams excelled in creating
                                an inviting and intuitive UX/UI design, but the UTC “Brogrammers” took it a step
                                further by adding a mini-game to their app."
