        <h1>Why I Chose UTC</h1>
        <p>
            UT Chattanooga has a much more modern and dynamically changing Computer Science curriculum compared to
            many others, which are not subdivided into specialties as they are at UTC. Additionally, these other schools
            often focus on much more primitive and on a machine level technologies. While these are practical to some
            degree, they did not pertain to my interests and quite frankly do not reflect the future of web-based
            services.
        </p>
        <p>
            UTC offered so many opportunities beyond the scope of day-to-day class that I would never have had at MTSU.
            Working with Dr. Mina Sartipi's research team has been the greatest proof of the opportunities lurking at
            UTC. Working under her has taught me how to teach <i>myself</i> - learning Python, Computer Vision and
            Machine Learning in my first month with her pushed me off a cliff where my only parachute was to dedicate
            myself and learn the content.
