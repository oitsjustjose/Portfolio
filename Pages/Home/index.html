        <h2>Hi there, my name is Jose Stovall.</h2>

        <p>
            I'm a multifacted developer with interests and hobbies in <i>many</i> different fields. I'll have my
            Master's in Computer Science: Data Science from the University of Tennessee @ Chattanooga by May 2020. This
            page is my (new-ish) home page where you can find all sorts of information about my work. I have a few
            different skills that I'll have listed out here! You can find more details on my individual work on the <a
                href="/Pages/Portfolio/">Portfolio page</a>, and you can learn more about my education background on the
            <a href="/Pages/Education/">Education Page</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Python</h2>

        <h3>
            Computer Vision, CNN's, Object Tracking
        </h3>

        <p>
            Since 2017, I've had experience of using Python for various computer vision tasks, ranging from detection
            via CNN (including <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/" target="_blank">YOLO</a>). I'm quite
            familiar with making models using Keras + Tensorflow, and am reasonably comfortable with <i>using</i> CUDA
            for graphical acceleration (such as CUDA-accelerated CNNs, CUDA-accelerated FFMPEG for real-time decoding,
            and more).
        </p>

        <div class="narrow divider"> </div>

        <h3>
            Everything.. else??
        </h3>

        <p>
            I use Python for several other tasks, such as automating IoT debugging, parsing and automating big-data
            tasks, crunching data using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, creating a
            playlist-able kiosk for Raspberry Pi's using Selenium, and more. I'm <i>very</i> comfortable with Python
            (it's almost a second language!) so if you need a task done in Python, I will likely be confident in my
            ability to do it.

            I could go on and on about my experience in front-end development, or you can look at this site as well as
            others in my <a href="/Pages/Portfolio/">portfolio</a>.

        <h3>
            Back-End

        <p>
            My experience is mostly in NodeJS using ExpressJS and encryption strategies such as BCrypt over
            <b>HTTPS</b>. I do not have any security background, but I am always learning the best and most secure
            methods of storing and managing data before I implement anything.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also have experience in using Flask (for Python) as a back-end for web development. This isn't something I
            do often as it's not nearly as flexible, but it's an option that I've found need for many times in the past,
            especially in research. Overall, my preferred platform is NodeJS + ExpressJS but this isn't a requirement.

            Java Development
        </h2>

        <p>
            So it's funny, this is actually what got me into development in the first place! I originally started my
            pursuit for higher education in 2011, where I decided I wanted to get a degree in Digital Animation but
            never wanted to work for Pixar or Dreamwork ðŸ¤”. After a semester of this, I took some time to reflect and
            couldn't come up with anything interesting even in the slightest, until a friend of mine convinced me to try
            modding <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> - everyone's favorite block-based
            sandbox.
        </p>

        <p>
            We spent the entire winter break on 12-18 hour Skype calls, and ended up making a terrifyingly awful (at
            least, in hindsight) mod for Minecraft. While I had no idea what I was doing (and wouldn't for another 4
            years), I enjoyed the ability to manipulate things we use every day with some code.
            <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/oitsjustjose/projects" target="_blank">I still make mods</a> and
            recently hit <b>10 Million Mod Downloads</b> via the most commonly used mod hosting platform. I still can't
            believe my content has come this far, but with practice and dedication I've been able to refine my mods to
            levels I could've never imagined!
