                Juice-UI, my JQuery-Free Theme Kit
            </h3>

            <p>
                So this has been a fun side-project for me, that started out with a simple desire to write my own stuff
                from scratch. I've been using the <a href="https://semantic-ui.com" target="_blank">Semantic-UI</a>
                themekit for years, but finally I decided to both learn a new theming language (SCSS) and add some
                challenges - not only to design everything myself in a way that is dynamically re-themeable, but to not
                use JQuery - a JavaScript library I've become <i>very</i> familiar with. Don't get me wrong, I don't
                have any qualms with JQuery, I just wanted to add a challenge since JQuery isn't anything more than a
                wrapper for convenient DOM + CSS calls.

                In 2018, Dr. Mina Sartipi at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga started a research
                group in the SimCenter, the <a href="https://utccuip.com" target="_blank">Center for Urban
                    Informatics and Progress (CUIP)</a>. CUIP has aimed to be a nexus for collaboration with
                members of the city, other universities, and more. With our partnerships, we have been
                granted 16 poles on a mile-long stretch of Martin Luther King Blvd.. With this, we have
                launched a scalable infrastructure capable of expanding both hardware and software. As part
                of an ever-expanding project, I have created an object tracker (seen <a
                    href="https://www.utccuip.com/object-tracking" target="_blank">here</a>) that is
                parallelized, resilient and produces nearly 500,000 data entries a week <i>per camera</i>.
                This algorithm allows us to store anonymous data on Kafka, and functions in <b>real
                    time</b>. This algorithm allows for many data analytics in the future, and has already
                revealed many trends that can be addressed by the city or its members.

                To follow up on our CAV (Connected Autonomous Vehicles) initiative, for the 2018 conference
                the team decided to work on a unified map for anonymously mapping many subjects of interest.
                For the most part, the above video I made should suffice as explanation, but it was fun

                This programming project was quite a hurdle for me. The 2017 SCCC was in late June, and I joined the
                research group in early May. I had never done networking, computer vision or machine learning in my
                life, nor had I ever written in Python. Yet our team managed to get this together, with myself
                handling at least 70% of the workload. This project had a live-demo that took everyone by surprise,
                but was <i>incredibly</i> stressful on my end. Nonetheless, this was the first time that I felt
                confident that I could accomplish anything I ever wanted.

                Engineering Department. The fifteen teams in the competition were tasked with creating a
                mobile app that allows consumers to digitally keep track of their physical conditions. The
                first and second place teams excelled in creating an inviting and intuitive UX/UI design,
                but the UTC “Brogrammers” took it a step further by adding a mini-game to their app."

                This was my first detailed look at HTML, CSS and JavaScript - before this point I only had
                minor experience, and still only consider myself amateur at best. Regardless, this was a
                fantastic learning experience and great practive of my program design skills!

                I will not be revealing too much information for the sake of respect to the Nissan
                dealership which offered me the program contract, but this marks the first time I was
                <i>ever</i> paid to program! The program was a simple, UI-based string comparator which
                allowed a user to select a file, paste a list, and then compare both string collections and
                output which did not match. While this sounds vague, consider it in the context of comparing
                incoming vehicles with current stock.
